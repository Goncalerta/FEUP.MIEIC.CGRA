(add your main observations/remarks about your experiments here, in a bulleted list, and remove this line. Some examples below)

- In the Experiments section, we noticed the differences between the lights and what resulted if some aspects were changed (position, attenuation, colors, shininess, ...). Ambient light did not depend on the object's position nor on the observer's position (because it is constant in every direction); Diffuse light depended on the object position relative to the light source; Especular light depended both on the object position and on the observer's position.
- Before declaring the normals for MyTangram and MyUnitCube, the lighting was very unnatural.
- After declaring the normals, the light was more consistent, however there were some imperfections in the Tangram, which can probably be explained because the different sizes of each piece, which leads to a different density of vertices in different parts of the image.
