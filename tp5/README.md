## TP 5 Notes

### Week 1

- We learned how to create and apply shaders to our scenes.
- In exercise 1, we noticed that in order to alter the color based on the position of the teapot instead of just coloring a fixed half of the teapot, we had to use the position after applying the transformations.
- Exercise 3 is very similar to the "Sepia" fragment shader, with the only difference being the values for the color: both red, green and blue had to have the same value so that the saturation is 0 and that value was given in the TP instructions.
