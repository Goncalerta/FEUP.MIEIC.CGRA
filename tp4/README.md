## TP 4 Notes

- In the Experiments section, we noticed the effects that were caused by changing the coordenates of S and T and the wrap mode, resulting on different transformations of the image.
- In the first part of the exercises (Tangram), we had to identify correctly the texture coordenates that corresponded to each vertice of the tangram. Some figures (MyTriangleBig and MyTriangleSmall) were used twice to build the trangram in different postisions. In order to use the corresponding figure with a especific color, we had to specity the text coordenates for each object.  
- In the last part of the exercises (Cube), we had to apply specific texture to each face of the cube. To do so, we identified the faces and applied the respective texture.
